This is the front end to an ethereum lottery contract built using ReactJS. 

I had to make a different repo because the node module 'create-react-app' makes it difficult to intergrate with other code bases, like the existing [lottery contract](https://github.com/Frothacker/Lottery-solidity). 

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
